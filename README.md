# CCTweaked-ReactorControl
Basic Big/Extreme Reactor info display and control. It autodetects display size, just if you set it bigger than the actual info displayed, it will look weird.

**To-Do:**
- Add rod control.
- Add graphical representations for data.
- Add touch capabilities.

**Additional Info:**
There are older and way better Reactor Control programs made for CC but since some servers don't allow the use of HTTP.api then I made my own, you can download the file and then move it into the Basic/Advanced Screen in Minecraft, it will copy it to your computer in the game.
